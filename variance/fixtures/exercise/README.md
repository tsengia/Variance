# Naming convention for exercises:
`[grip-variation] [body-posture-variation] [DB | Cable | Lever | Weighted | Assisted] <root motion name>`  

DB is short for Dumbbells. If it lacks DB and is weighted, assume barbell.  

The "Cable" modifier is used to denote that the exercise is performed with some form of cabled machine.  
The "Lever" modifier is used to denote that the exercise is performed with some form of leverage machine  
The "Weighted" modifier is used for bodyweight exercises that use additional weight (chains, plates, medicine balls, etc.)  
The "Assisted" modifier is used for bodyweight exercises that use equipment or human assistance to complete the exercise (bands, cables, etc.)  

grip-variation = Wide or Narrow (biacromial - armpit to armpit distance)  

body-posture-variation = Flat, Upright (90 degrees), Incline, Decline, Seated, Standing  

This is not an exhaustive convention, however it is enough for a preliminary collection of exercises.

# Canonical Naming
All exercise names will be given a canonical name that consists of the display name converted to kebab-style.  
This means the display name will be converted to lower case, and spaces will be replaced with dashes.  
Examples: "Bench Press" becomes `bench-press`, "Seated Cable Rows" becomes `seated-cable-rows`.
