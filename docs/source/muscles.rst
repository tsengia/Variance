Muscles
===============================

Variance represents skeletal muscles through the :py:class:`~variance.models.muscle.MuscleModel` Model. 

These muscles can be grouped together into :py:class:`~variance.models.MuscleGroupModel`\s.

A muscle can be in mutliple muscle groups at the same time.

Sometimes it can be helpful to break down individual muscles further
into sections, such as upper, middle, and lower sections of the pectoral muscles.  

In this case, these sections are represented by the :py:class:`~variance.models.muscle.MuscleSectionModel`.
