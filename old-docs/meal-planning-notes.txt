Current meal plan algorithm:
 - 3 meals a day, 2 snacks
 - veggies at each meal
 - lean/low/no fat meals
 - complex carbs
 - currently not estimating carbs, but should be in the future
 - No same meal repeated in a week, no same dish repeated within the day
 - no/low dairy (I don't like stomach aches)
 - no peanuts (acne sucks)
 - no pork (just doesnt feel right)
 - attempts to track macronutrients

 - 1 protein
 - 1 veggie
